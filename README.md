First I had to get an api key from the weather API.  Used https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys to get a weather API key.

Then I added the search bar for different cities.

Then I added the 5 day forecast.

I kept trying to change the constant for the weather, but I couldn't get all dates to change, it would either be off by a month, or all say the same current date.
